# Coursera Machine Learning Classification

These are my lab solutions for the oursera Machine Learning Classification course. 

- Module 2: application of a logistic classifier for sentiment analysis
- Module 3: implementation and  application of a logistic classifier using gradient descent  descent algorithm
- Module 4: implementation and  application of a logistic classifier with l2 penalty using gradient descent algorithm
- Module 5 and 6: implementation and  application of a decision tree classifier
- Module 8: implementation and  application of an adaboost classifier
- Module 9: exploring precision and recall using a logistic classifier
- Module 10: implementation of a logistic classifier with stochastic gradient descent for  big data applications
